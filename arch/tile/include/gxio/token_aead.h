 * The AEAD token processes AEAD requests.
 *
 * Before packets are processed with this interface, basic data
 * structures need to be initialized at the gxcr_aead level.
 *
 * The setup function sets initialization-time fields in the token.
 * This must be called before data is processed with the process functions
 * aead_process() or aead_process_start().
 *
 * The processing functions perform the crypto/digest operation.
 * The result of the crypto operation is stored in the destination
 * memory provided as an argument to the process function, the result
 * of a digest operation is appended to the end of the result data.
