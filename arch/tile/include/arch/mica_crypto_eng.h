/*
 * TRNG Poker Test Result.
 * These registers are used to access the 16 counters used perform a poker
 * test on blocks of 20000 bits (in parallel to the run test). Each of these
 * 16 counters counts the occurrences of one specific 4-bit value in the data
 * stream fed into the main LFSR, with all the counters decremented by one
 * every 64 data bits and reset to their start value every 20000 bits. All
 * counters start at value 1 and are decremented 312 times during the 20000
 * bit test run.
 * Each 8 bits counter holds a 2s complement value and will not overflow past
 * the range 128  +127. At the end of the 20000 bits block the values of the
 * counters with a single 1 bit appended at the least significant bit side
 * are individually squared and then added together  the poker test fails
 * (with a poker_fail interrupt) when the resulting sum is outside the range
 * 1288  71749 or one of the counters tries to increment or decrement outside
 * its limit range.
 * Note
 * s:
 *  The poker test fails when the 4 bits values of the data stream are
 * distributed too evenly (with 8 counters having incremented 312 times and
 * the others incremented 313 times), this is fully intentional. The minimum
 * mean deviation from the expected value of 312.5 is 4.5.
 *  Failure at counter overflow is not an official part of the poker test as
 * specified in the AIS-31 standard (ref [11]). It can be shown that the
 * maximum deviation for one counters value from the mean value of 312.5
 * (without the poker test failing) is 129.5  as this deviation is more than
 * 40% of the mean value it is clearly an indication that something is wrong.
 * When the cont_poker bit in the TRNG_TEST register is set to 1, the test is
 * not stopped after 20000 bits  the counters keep incrementing and
 * decrementing (the latter every 64 bits) and a poker_fail interrupt is
 * generated when one of the counters tries to increment or decrement outside
 * its limit range.
 * Poker test result registers are all read-only  writing them accesses
 * TRNG_V_... registers mapped at these same addresses. All counters in these
 * registers are reset when writing a 1 to either the run_fail_ack or the
 * poker_fail_ack bits in the TRNG_INTACK register.
